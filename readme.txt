Git is a distributed version control system.
Git is free software distributed under the GPL.
Git has a mutable index called stage.
Git tracks changes of files.
My stupid boss still prefers SVN.
Creating a new branch is quick.
git branch <name> #create new branch 
git branch #view the branch
git merge <branch_name>
git branch -d <branch_name>  #delete branch
Creating a new branch is quick and simple.
modify in origin/master
change in origin/master
modify in local master
change in master
